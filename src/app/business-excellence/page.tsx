          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            Kaizen initiative, driven by the
            Business Excellence team, has
            become a catalyst for continuous,
            employee-led improvements across
            functions including Business
            Development. To nurture this culture,
            an organization-wide competition
            was launched, encouraging
            employees to contribute simple,
            impactful ideas aimed at enhancing
            efficiency, sustainability and costeffectiveness. Over 25 Kaizen entries
            were submitted by teams across
            departments, reflecting a strong
            culture of continuous improvement.

          <h1 className='text-2xl mb-5'>
            The top three initiatives
            were recognized and

            during Susten's Annual
            Conclave.

          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            Kaizens were evaluated based on
            impact categories Productivity, Quality,
            Cost, Delivery, Safety, Morale and
            Environment (PQCDSME) ensuring
            horizontal deployment of Kaizen.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-5'>
            Each Kaizen submission is evaluated
            and scored based on clear criteria,
            including how well the problem is
            defined, quality of data and analysis,
            effectiveness of the action plan, risk
            assessment and potential for broader
            implementation. The aim is to promote
            practical, innovative thinking from all
            levels of the organization.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-5'>
            To encourage wider participation, an
            online Kaizen portal was launched
            on RE-GIST, making it easier for
            employees to share their ideas. The
            platform allows users to submit entries
            along with before-and-after data,
            visuals and impact metrics.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-5'>
            To encourage continued involvement,
            recognition is an integral part of the
            system with top ideas being featured
            as Kaizen of the Month, Quarter and
            Year, all displayed on the platform to
            inspire others.
