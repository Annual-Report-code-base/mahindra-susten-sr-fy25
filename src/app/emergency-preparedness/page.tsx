          Our emergency management strategy is designed to ensure rapid
          response, controlled evacuation and minimal disruption during any
          crisis. Each site has an Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) that
          details roles, communication protocols, escape routes and muster
          locations. These plans are updated quarterly and tested through
          monthly mock drills that simulate fire outbreaks, accidents, natural
          disasters and medical emergencies.
