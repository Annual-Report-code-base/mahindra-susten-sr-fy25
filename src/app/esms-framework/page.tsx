        <h2 className='text-xl font-bold mb-5'>
          Our ESMS constitutes the keystone of our 
          responsibility. It is a structured system designed to maintain oversight and
          report on critical environmental parameters. The system ensures compliance
          with both national regulatory requirements and global environmental
          standards (e.g., IFC Performance Standards). The framework affords us the
          ability to govern a wide array of indicators across our operations. These
          encompass emissions, water consumption, biodiversity impacts, waste and
          occupational safety risks.
        </h2>
        <p className='mb-8'>
          In addition, the framework aids in the early identification of project-specific risks, such as land use implications, ecological
          disruption or local community issues. By integrating this at the inception stage of our projects, we are able to implement
          tailored mitigation strategies and cultivate community trust. Our objective of reaching full ESMS compliance for greenfield
          projects by FY26 reflects our commitment to responsible growth and long-term value creation.
