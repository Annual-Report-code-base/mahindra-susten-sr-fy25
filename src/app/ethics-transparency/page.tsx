          At Mahindra Susten, ethics and integrity form the bedrock of how we operate
          within our teams, with our partners and across every aspect of our business.
          For us, doing what is right is not merely an obligation, it is a way of life. This
          belief is an expression of our culture and reflection of our long-term vision.

        <p className='mb-5'>
          Our structured ethics and compliance
          framework guided by Mahindra
          Group’s ensures that we consistently
          meet the highest standards of
          conduct, guided in the Mahindra
          Group’s longstanding legacy of
          responsible governance. We have
          instituted robust policies and systems
          to ensure adherence to applicable
          laws, regulations and internal code
          of conduct. These are not mere rules,
          they are enduring principles that
          inform and elevate our daily decisions
          and actions.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-5'>
          Integrity is embedded into our
          operations through regular awareness
          programs, transparent reporting
          mechanisms, and close oversight by
          our leadership. We continue to align
          ourselves with the Mahindra Group’s
          Code of Conduct, as well as Mahindra
          Susten’s Code of Conduct for
          Employees, which outlines expected
          ethical standards and professional
          behavior across the organization.
          This policy is supported by an active
          Ethics Committee that ensures proper
          governance and addresses concerns
          in a fair and timely manner. Together,
          these measures help nurture a
          workplace environment anchored in
          honesty, fairness and accountability.
          During the reporting period, there
          were no instances of significant fines
          or regulatory infractions. We remain
          resolute in maintaining this track record
          through strict oversight and sustained
          improvement.
