          A clearly defined governance framework ensures that safety performance
          is driven with discipline and ownership. The HSE Lead reports directly
          to the Operations Head and engages regularly with the Central Safety
          Council at the Mahindra Group level.

        <p className='mb-5'>
          This structure enables top-down alignment while allowing bottom-up feedback to drive local implementation. Each project is
          supported by Regional HSE Leads, Assistant Managers and Safety Engineers, with clearly mapped responsibilities outlined
          in the site organogram.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-5'>
          Monthly reviews of safety performance are conducted at both the central and site levels. These meetings include discussion
          of incidents, training gaps, leading indicators and high-risk observations. Accountability is built into our performance
          systems through Project Safety Maturity Index (PSMI) scores and individual-level Employee Safety Performance Scorecards
          (ESPS). These metrics directly influence appraisals, development plans and incentive structures — reinforcing a culture
          where safety is a shared responsibility for safety across roles and hierarchies.
