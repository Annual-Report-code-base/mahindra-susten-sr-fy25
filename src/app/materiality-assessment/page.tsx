          Approach and methodology for
          materiality mapping
        </h2>
        <p className='mb-5'>
          Materiality assessment serves
          as a foundation for identifying
          and managing the most relevant
          environmental, social and governance
          (ESG) topics that influence our long term performance and stakeholder
          expectations. Our approach to
          materiality mapping is rooted in
          global best practices and tailored
          to our business context, operational
          geography and industry relevance.
          The assessment was conducted in
          line with the AA1000 Stakeholder
          Engagement Standard and aligned
          with leading international ESG
          disclosure frameworks.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-5'>
          We have conducted a comprehensive
          peer benchmarking exercise,
          analyzing both local and global
          renewable energy companies. This
          included a structured review of
          sustainability disclosures and ESG
          performance of peers to identify
          recurring and emerging material topics
          within the sector. The outcome of this
          benchmarking offered us valuable
          insight into industry-aligned priorities
          and areas of strategic importance.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-5'>
          In parallel, we undertook a detailed
          review of globally recognized
          reporting frameworks GRI, SASB,
          CDP, MSCI, DJSI and the UN
          Sustainable Development Goals
          (UNSDGs) to ensure our material
          topics are aligned with international
          sustainability expectations as well.
          This multi-framework lens enabled us
          to refine our list of topics in line with
          evolving disclosure norms and investor
          interests.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-5'>
          The material topics were shared
          with the identified stakeholder
          groups, allowing sufficient time for
          review and response. Feedback
          was received from over 50% of the
          mapped stakeholders within the given
          timeframe. Using the inputs provided,
          average scores were calculated
          for each material topic across the
          various stakeholder categories.
          These responses formed the basis
          for the materiality analysis, ensuring
          that the findings reflect a broad and
          representative range of stakeholder
          perspectives.
