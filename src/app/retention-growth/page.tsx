          Retention efforts at Mahindra Susten are closely integrated with our growth
          and development strategies. The introduction of mid-year reviews through
          Darwinbox has brought greater structure to performance conversations,
          allowing for timely feedback and mid-cycle course correction. High potential talent and critical roles are tracked through structured calibration
          sessions between Heads of Department and the CHRO. This enables
          targeted interventions such as cross-functional projects, training programs
          and fast-track career paths.
        </h2>
        <p className='mb-5'>
          Recognition at Mahindra Susten is both structured and spontaneous, designed to celebrate a
          range of contributions, from consistent performance and bold innovation to collaborative spirit and
          community involvement.
