          We reinforce safe behavior through structured recognition practices
          that encourage visible leadership and compliance across sites.
          High-performing individuals and teams are recognized as part of
          our ongoing HSE Reward and Recognition program, with site-level
          awards in categories such as Best Safety Officer, Safe Contractor, Safe
          Operator or Driver and Best Site Supervisor.

        <p className='mb-5'>
          These recognitions are based on audit results, proactive safety actions and peer feedback, and are
          announced during safety campaigns or town halls. By celebrating these efforts, we encourage a
          culture where safety performance is acknowledged, appreciated and emulated.
