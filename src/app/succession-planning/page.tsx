          <p>We comprehend that leadership continuity is intrinsic to long term
            success. Building on this belief, we have instituted a comprehensive
            succession planning framework, which is guided by our Nomination and
            Remuneration Committee (NRC) Policy to identify and prepare future
            leaders across all key roles. This ensures that we are staffed with capable
            individuals, who are prepared to transition into positions of responsibility
            as the organization evolves. </p>
