                    Sustainability and EHS (Environment, Health and Safety) governance
                    are intricately woven into the philosophy of our operations. We do not
                    view these as standalone functions, but as integral components of our
                    design, execution and delivery of clean energy solutions. Our governance
                    structure ensures that sustainability imperatives are aligned with business
                    objectives. Our comprehensive EHS protocols guide every stage of project
                    execution, from site selection through to final commissioning.

                    The committee entrusted with the oversight of these efforts is instrumental in advancing our ESG agenda, ensuring
                    compliance with global standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and our Environment and Social Management
                    System (ESMS). Through strong leadership, well-defined accountability and sustained monitoring, we strive to safeguard
                    people, preserve the environment and contribute meaningfully to an equitable and low-carbon future.
