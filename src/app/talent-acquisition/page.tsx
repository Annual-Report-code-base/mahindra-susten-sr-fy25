          At Mahindra Susten, we place strong emphasis on providing a welcoming experience for all new employees. Our onboarding framework is built on standard operating procedures that guide the first few weeks of every new hire's journey. On Day 1, a dedicated buddy is assigned to each new joiner, offering support and fostering camaraderie.

          Induction sessions are tailored to functional bands and include detailed modules on organizational culture, policies, job expectations and compliance essentials. To ensure alignment between individual roles and business outcomes, all new hires complete a SMART goals workshop within their first month. This sets the foundation for structured performance and accountability.

            We are committed to upholding
            fairness, inclusivity and transparency
            in our hiring processes. Our internal
            mobility platform, PEOPLE 2.0,
            ensures that existing employees are
            prioritized for roles based on their
            eligibility, promoting internal career
            progression and talent continuity.
          </p>
          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            The process is criteria-based and
            transparent, enabling employees to
            plan their development journeys within
            the organization. Employee referrals,
            encouraged across the Mahindra
            Group, serve as a trusted channel to
            attract culturally aligned talent.

            For external recruitment, our outreach
            spans online job portals, professional
            networks, recruitment partners and targeted campus placements. Our
            structured graduate intake program
            ensures a steady flow of early-career
            talent through GMCs (Management
            Graduates) and GETs (Graduate
            Engineer Trainees). Rehiring former
            employees is also a part of our
            strategy. Each case is assessed
            based on tenure, past performance
            and alignment with Mahindra Susten's
            evolving goals and values.
