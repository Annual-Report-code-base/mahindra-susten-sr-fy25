          ESG Risk Management

          We believe that ESG risk management is more than a mere compliance
          formality. It is crucial component embedded within our daily operations.
          We recognize that environmental, social and governance risks are
          intrinsic to our broader risk framework. This integrated approach
          enables us to anticipate, assess and mitigate potential threats that could
          affect our business continuity and the communities we serve.
        </h2>
        <p className='mb-5'>
          We have methodically developed our ESG risk map, which is aligned with key operational, financial
          and business risk categories. This exercise sharpened our focus, bringing clarity to the risk areas that
          hold the greatest consequences for long-term success.
