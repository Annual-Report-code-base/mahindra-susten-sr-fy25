          In today’s dynamic business environment,
          effective risk management is essential not only to
          safeguard the organization against uncertainties
          but also to build resilience, ensure regulatory
          compliance, protect stakeholder interests and
          seize emerging opportunities. Whether it is
          related to climate, technology, supply chain
          or regulatory shifts, timely identification and
          mitigation of risks help us maintain business
          continuity and uphold stakeholder trust.

            Step into Hybrid Energy
          </h2>
          <p className='mb-5'>
            In our clean energy journey, we have launched its firstever hybrid renewable energy project a strategic leap
            that reinforces Mahindra Group’s ambition to be a leader
            in sustainable infrastructure and accelerate India’s green
            transition. This landmark initiative goes beyond conventional
            solar or wind solutions by seamlessly integrating both
            sources into a co-located hybrid system, signaling a new
            era of energy innovation.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-5'>
            Located in Maharashtra, this project brings together
            100 MWp of wind and 70 MWp of solar capacity, making it
            one of the largest hybrid developments in the state. Once
            commissioned, it is expected to generate approximately
            460* million units of green electricity annually, reducing
            nearly 4.2* lakhs tonnes of CO2
            emissions each year,
            resulting into a meaningful contribution towards the nation’s
            decarbonization and net-zero goals.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-5'>
            Designed for Mahindra’s own manufacturing operations,
            the project will supply clean energy to its Auto and
            Farm divisions, directly supporting EV production and
            sustainable manufacturing. With majority of its components
            sourced domestically, the project also fuels the vision of
            Aatmanirbhar Bharat, strengthening India’s renewable
            energy supply chain.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-5'>
            Backed by a strategic partnership with the Ontario Teachers’
            Pension Plan, this hybrid facility is more than a milestone.
            It is a bold demonstration of Mahindra Susten’s ability
            to deliver high-impact, investor-trusted and future-ready
            energy solutions.
