          Our QA team plays an integral role in safeguarding the long-term
          sustainability and resilience of every project that we deliver. During vendor
          audits, we assess practices related to climate risk mitigation, waste handling,
          operator safety and material efficiency. End-to-end material traceability is
          maintained through digital tools. These tools allow us to track performance,
          support warranty claims and upgrade specifications based on field data.
        </h2>
        <p className='mb-5'>
          Material review also encompasses checks on recyclability and long-term durability. Our approach ensures that each
          component, which is being utilized supports the project's performance over its intended life, while reducing the risk of
          premature failure or resource-intensive maintenance. Additionally, we follow a First-Time-Right approach, where mock-ups
          precede all critical activities, and work begins only after quality clearance. On-site labs ensure rigorous material testing,
          while execution is guided by detailed photographic work instructions, safety signage, and tailored induction training
          ensuring seamless delivery with minimal environmental impact and maximum operational efficiency.

            Standardize Vendor and Contractor Quality
          </h3>
          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            To maintain consistency in material and service quality, all vendors and subcontractors undergo stringent screenings using formalized evaluation tools VAR (Vendor Assessment Report) for suppliers and SCAR (Subcontractor Assessment Report) for service contractors. These tools assess technical compliance, execution capability and field performance. Contracts are issued only upon successful scoring and audits, including third-party inspections for all A and B class components.
          </p>
          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            Vendor performance is tracked on a project-specific basis through a quality rating system based on defect rates, site complaints and overall delivery standards. Subcontractors are assessed similarly and only consistent performers are re-engaged across new land parcels and sites.

          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            Our QA structure strikes a balance between centralized governance and decentralized execution. Each project site is staffed with Dedicated Field Quality Managers across civil, mechanical, electrical domains, all of whom report to the domain-specific leads at the head office. A rotating site engagement schedule ensures sustained oversight and knowledge transfer.
          </p>
          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            We follow the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) model to drive improvement. Daily Quality Registers (DQR), site technical audits and internal reviews feed insights into design and procurement systems. Weekly Quality Review Meetings (QRMs) enable cross-site learning from observed non-conformities and their resolutions. Key learnings are documented and relevant SOPs, checklists and QAPs are updated to reflect evolving best practices.

          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            We ensure that all materials used in our projects meet high environmental and safety standards. Before we work with any vendor, we check if they are certified for environmental (ISO 14001), quality (ISO 9001), and workplace safety (ISO 45001) systems. Our teams visit vendor sites to see how they manage things like pollution, water use, worker safety and whether they follow fair labour practices.
          </p>
          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            We also have a strong system to track every material we use from the time it's made to the time it's installed on-site. Our in-house digital tools like RE-GIST and REDOMS help us keep records of each component, making it easier to improve quality, handle future repairs and meet customer expectations.

            Unified Approach to Excellence
          </h3>
          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            Delivering excellence goes beyond
            project execution it's about embedding
            quality, safety and sustainability into
            everything we do. To achieve this,
            we have implemented an Integrated
            Management System (IMS) that
            brings together our core operational
            commitments under a single,
            structured framework. This system
            ensures that our processes not only
            meet global standards but also reflect
            our values of responsibility, efficiency
            and continuous improvement.
          </p>
          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            The IMS aligns with the international
            standards for Quality (ISO 9001:2015),
            Environmental Management (ISO
            14001:2015) and Occupational
            Health & Safety (ISO 45001:2018). It
            integrates policies, procedures and
            best practices across the entire project
            lifecycle, from design and procurement
            to construction, commissioning and
            handover.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-5'>
            Through the IMS, we conduct regular
            risk assessments, maintain legal
            compliance registers, carry out internal
            audits and promote employee training
            and emergency preparedness. This
            system also drives our commitment
            to customer satisfaction, resource
            efficiency and zero-harm operations.
            Our IMS is key to ensuring that we
            deliver highest quality projects and it's
            supported by top management.

                    With Mahindra Susten scaling up to execute over 2 GW of solar capacity annually, the sourcing process became increasingly complex and repetitive. Each project team independently managed the full procurement cycle for thousands of items—generating redundancies, longer lead times, and inefficiencies in handling low-value, high-frequency materials. This decentralized approach also made it difficult to control vendor performance, ensure delivery consistency and leverage economies of scale.
