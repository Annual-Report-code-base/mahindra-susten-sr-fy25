          Training for Operational Safety Excellence

          We regard safety training not as an obligation but as a capability-building exercise that empowers our workforce. Our safety-related training programs encompass both foundational learning and refresher modules, ensuring continuous development. Training is organized in layers, covering general inductions, site-specific briefings, task-specific learning and third-party certifications for high-risk functions.

          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            Our 16 core training modules cover all critical areas such as working at heights, electrical safety, hot work, chemical handling and defensive driving. These are delivered at our AV-enabled safety center, 'Surakhsa Sikshala', an on-site HSE training hub equipped with audio-visual facilities and practical safety training modules. Further, hands-on sessions provide real-world knowledge to manage site-specific hazards effectively.
          </p>

          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            These modules are implemented through monthly training needs analysis conducted by site HSE teams, using incident learnings and site-specific observations. A monthly HSE plan is in place to ensure consistent safety practices across all sites. As per this plan, regular HSE trainings are conducted to enhance safety awareness and drive compliance. Task-specific training is delivered on the job by line managers, reinforcing contextual risk awareness and practical skill development.
          </p>

          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-5'>
            We also engage third-party agencies to deliver certified training in first aid, electrical safety, fire safety and rescue operations. Internally, our safety culture is reinforced through weekly safety themes, storytelling sessions, safety suggestion schemes and Kaizens. Learnings from incidents and audits are transformed into visual guides and shared across sites to embed a culture of continuous improvement. All training records are digitized and linked to individual learning dashboards, enabling tracking, compliance validation and proactive improvement planning.

            Training Approach
          </h3>

          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-4'>
            We have implemented a structured system to enhance employee safety performance through the Employee Safety Performance Scorecard (ESPS). As part of this system, safety training is embedded within a broader process of auditing, reporting and performance evaluation. Activities such as walk-downs, HSE audits, behavior-based safety checks and mock drills are regularly conducted across project sites. These sessions not only enhance awareness but also ensure that employees are equipped to respond effectively to potential risks. Participation in training is closely tracked and contributes directly to an individual's ESPS score. Achieving 100% employee engagement is our objective, with the system designed to ensure every team member is an active participant in building a safer workplace.
          </p>

          <p className='text-[#58595b] mb-5'>
            The training efforts are closely aligned with the organizational objective of improving site safety performance by actively involving line managers and on-ground teams. By linking ESPS performance with individual KRAs, we are trying to encourage ownership of safety practices at all site level.
          </p>

          <p className='text-[#58595b]'>
            This training-led approach has led to significant improvements in employee engagement, safety culture and operational discipline. Monthly performance evaluations, coupled with recognition programs, such as ESPS Champions, have enhanced a culture of continuous improvement.
